This dashboard triggers the private agent that collects arXiv papers, summarizes them, and publishes a digest post.

Open the console here: `/agent/`

Recommended flow:
1. Run a dry run to verify summaries.
2. Disable dry run to commit the digest.
3. Wait for Vercel to redeploy and the note will appear in the blog.
