This note collects recurring patterns I keep seeing in new AI papers. It is intentionally general and updated as I read more.

## Common themes
- **Data quality over quantity**: cleaner data pipelines and synthetic data filtering are treated as first-class contributions.
- **Compute-aware training**: papers increasingly report compute budgets and efficiency trade-offs.
- **Evaluation realism**: more work focuses on messy, real-world tasks rather than short benchmarks.
- **Tool use and workflows**: systems combine models with retrieval, tools, or code execution.

## What I want to see more of
- Clearer negative results and failure analysis.
- Shared evaluation suites that survive beyond a single paper.
- More transparent reporting on data sources and filtering.
